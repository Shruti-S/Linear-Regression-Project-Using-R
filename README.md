# Linear-Regression-Project-Using-R

This was a collaborative project I did in one of my undergraduate Statistics classes. We had to clean and partition the data frame provided to us and perform linear regression analytics on the variables we were interested in. 

For this project, the data set was derived from the Journal of Political Economy and it was comprised of aggregated data from 47 states in 1960 and contains fifteen variables including population information, income, and wage disparities, racial information, education levels, work-force participation, number of offenses and time served. 

In this project we explored the effects of education, race, police expenditure and probability ofimprisonment on crime rate in an area.
